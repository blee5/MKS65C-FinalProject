ganache is a simple web server written in C.
By default, it will open port 80 (used for HTTP port).

Port 80 is a reserved port, and requires sudo permissions to open.
If you have sudo access, run ganache using sudo.
Otherwise, specify another port in the command line arguement, by:
`./ganache <port>`
